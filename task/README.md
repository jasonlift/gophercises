# CLI Task Manager
In this exercise we are going to be building a CLI tool that can be used to manage your TODOs in the terminal. 
To implement the desired functionalities of the CLI tool, I use two main third-party golang packages: [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt).

# 1. Build CLI shell

# 2. Write data to BoltDB

# 3. Put it together
